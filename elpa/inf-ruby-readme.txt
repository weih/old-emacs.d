;; If you're installing manually, you'll need to:
;; * drop the file somewhere on your load path (perhaps ~/.emacs.d)
;; * Add the following lines to your .emacs file:
;;    (autoload 'inf-ruby "inf-ruby" "Run an inferior Ruby process" t)
;;    (autoload 'inf-ruby-keys "inf-ruby" "" t)
;;    (eval-after-load 'ruby-mode
;;      '(add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook 'inf-ruby-keys))
